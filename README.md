### avalanche-plugins-core

`avalanche-plugins-core` is plugin repository that ships with the [apm](https://github.com/ava-labs/apm). A plugin repository consists of a set of virtual machine and subnet definitions that the `apm` consumes to allow users to quickly and easily download and manage VM binaries.

To build your own plugin repository, you can clone this repository and make your own `*.yaml` definition files under the `vms/` and `subnets/` directories.

### Contributing

This repository is meant to be driven by the community! If you have a virtual machine or a subnet you'd like to make available here, please submit a pull request or open a github issue.
