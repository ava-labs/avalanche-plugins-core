    The WAGMI ("We're All Going to Make It") Subnet Demo is a high throughput testbed for EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) optimizations. It is parameterized to run at a factor more capacity than Fuji/Mainnet C-Chain and will be used to experiment with release candidates before they make it into an official coreth release.
